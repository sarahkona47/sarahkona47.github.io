## Vision
‚ÄúGambling made simple, easy, and gamified - without consequences!"\
\
Inspired by the gambling game called "crash", we welcome you to experience the addictive world of gambling through our chicken crash simulator.

## To Play

### Where to Play
Users are able to play the game at this link: https://sarahkona47.github.io./ 

### Rules
In our crash simulator, we bet chickens instead of money. 

- Bet your chickens and watch it multiply!
- Cash out before the multiplier crashes; if not you will lose your bet!

You will be given 3 chickens to start, your goal is to win by reaching 100 chickens in your chicken coop. You will lose if you bet away all your chickens!/
